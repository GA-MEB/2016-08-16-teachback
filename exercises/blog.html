        <h2> The Best Batman -- Bale or Affleck? </h2>
        <p class='joker'> Joker: Neither. The correct answer is Kevin Conroy. </p>

        Of course. As far as the best <em>live action</em> Batman, however, that's another
          question. Here are the pros and cons of Christian Bale's and Ben
          Affleck's portrayals of the caped crusader in Christopher Nolan's
          <strong> Dark Knight </strong> trilogy and the new DC cinematic
          universe films, respectively.

        <ul>
          <lh> Christian Bale </lh>
          <li class='pro'> Pro: Right level of physicality. </li>
          <li class='pro'> Pro: Great portrayal of the man behind the mask, Bruce Wayne. </li>
          <li class='con'> Con: <strong>"WHERE RR THUH HSSTEGES"</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <lh> Ben Affleck </lh>
          <li class='pro'> Pro: Affleck's Batman had the feel of a strategist and planner -- something he's known for, but something Bale's Batman just... wasn't. </li>
          <li class='pro'> Pro: Strong performance both as Bruce Wayne <em> and </em> as Batman.</li>
          <li class='con'> Con: Writers, and a desparate, desparate studio that jus can't keep its mitts out of <em> anything </em>.</li>
